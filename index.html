                        <p>Jason recently graduated college with a degree in computer engineering but felt he was incredibly unprepared for the real world. As a result of this, he decided to partake in the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp.
                        Although he has had previous coding experience, he does not consider himself particularly skilled at it. It is his hope that this bootcamp will prepare him for the workforce,
                        and help him further develop the skills he has already acquired. His end goal here is to become the best developer he can possibly be.
            
                        <p>Assuming you would like to know more about Jason before looking at his currently non-existant portfolio, some of his interests include tennis, video games, anime, swimming, reading and nearly everything related to animals. He is extremely prone to rambling on forever when talking about 
                        the majority of these subjects. If you would like to know more about Jason, you are free to contact him through the contact page!
